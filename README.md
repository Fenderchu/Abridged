# Abridged
a little game project 



if you run into problems runing the code 

1 make sure youve structured the files corectly
somthing like

 game_folder-->
 
      Abridged_sprites
      
      Main_scripts
      
      Abridged_main.py

it important for file directory refrance reasons

2 make sure you have all dependancies taken care of

pygame, random, opensimplex, etc. all must be installed

3 make sure your using a python version > 3.0
